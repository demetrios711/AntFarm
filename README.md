# Antfarm - An Interactive "Conway's Game of Life"

## Background and Overview
    * Motivation for project
      * I want to have a better understanding of algorithms and have always been fascinated with simulations. 
    * High level overview
    
### Functionality and MVP Features
    * Base Grid Generation
      * Use can adjust grid size.
    * Cells 
       * Cell Types 
         - Still lifes (Cells that do not move)
         - Oscillators (Moving Cells)
    * Generation Parameters
      * Adjustable Base Rules - 
         1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
         2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.     
         3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
         4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction
