      * Adjustable Base Rules - 
         - Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
         - Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.     
         - Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
         - Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction
